Welcome to my Flatiron Sinatra Project! This app allows users to create an account, and then create their own book collection. Users may also edit and delete books from their collection, as well as view what other users have added to their shelf.

To use this app, clone the repo, and then run bundle install.

From there, run rake db:migrate. Run shotgun after that, and everything should work!
